	<h1>Project Information</h1>

	<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit <i>Who Died This Time: A Trigger Warning Database for Readers</i>. This project was created as part of the MA in Digital Publishing dissertation course and was supervised by Oxford Brookes University. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.doesthedogdie.com">DoesTheDogDie.com</a>, the purpose of this database is to act as an informational resource and to provide readers with peace of mind as they'll be able to track any content that could potentially trigger mental distress.</p>
	<p>According to the survey conducted during the creation of the database, close to <b>70%</b> of all 70 participants have read Young Adult fiction that contained heavy and/or trigger material and of those, close to <b>40%</b> have experiences come form of adverse psychological reaction to it, including, <b>Stress/Anxiety (65%)</b>, <b>Depression/Low Mood (34%)</b>, <b>OCD related intrusive thoughts (31%)</b>, <b>Panic Attacks (24%)</b> and <b>PTSD related flashbacks (13%)</b>. Moreover, according to psychology research by, the existence and access to trigger warnings can offer a sense of comfort and allow readers to employ anxiety management techniques [ResearchGate, 2016; APA PsychNet; The New York Times, 2015].</p>
