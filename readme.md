# The Repository for your Shakespeare Play Web page

You will be using InDesign to export the HTML and the file for the play should be put into the docs folder. This will then be linked from the `index.html` file that you will need to create or edit the existing one.

The web site is delivered using GitHub page from the `docs` folder.

There are 2 parts to this web site:

## The home page
You will create this yourself from the existing `index.html` page here.

The play itself will be exported from InDesign. The files that InDesign creates will need to be copied into the docs folder. The `index.html` file will then need to be edited to make the hyperlink from there to the play.

### The Play

Your play will have 3 parts - the _Table of Contents_, _Dramatis Personae_ and the _Play itself_. These should have their own `sections` in the HTML.

The _Table of Contents_ will become the navigation.
