<h2 class="location">Athens. Quince’s House</h2>
<h2 class="stagedirection">Enter <span class="charactername quince">Quince</span>, <span class="charactername snug">Snug</span>, <span class="charactername bottom">Bottom</span>, <span class="charactername flute">Flute</span>, <span class="charactername snout">Snout</span>, and <span class="charactername starveling">Starveling</span></h2>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Is all our company here?</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Here is the scroll of every man’s name which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his wedding-day at night.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Marry, our play is “<em>The most Lamentable Comedy and most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby.</em>“</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest— yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.</p>
<p class="verse">‘The raging rocks<br/>
And shivering shocks<br/>
Shall break the locks<br/>
Of prison gates;</p>
<p class="verse">And Phibbus’ car<br/>
Shall shine from far,<br/>
And make and mar<br/>
The foolish Fates.’ </p>
<p>This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein: a lover is more condoling.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</p>
<p class="character flute">Flute</p>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</p>
<p class="character flute">Flute</p>
<p>What is Thisby? A wand’ring knight?</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</p>
<p class="character flute">Flute</p>
<p>Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>That’s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: &#8220;<em>Thisne, Thisne!</em>&#8221; [Then speaking small] &#8220;<em>Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisby dear, and lady dear!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>Well, proceed.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Robin Starveling, the tailor.</p>
<p class="character starveling">Starveling</p>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby’s mother. Tom Snout, the tinker.</p>
<p class="character snout">Snout</p>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisby’s father; Snug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope, here is a play fitted.</p>
<p class="character snug">Snug</p>
<p>Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the Duke say “<em>Let him roar again, let him roar again.</em>“</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.</p>
<p class="character all">All</p>
<p>That would hang us, every mother’s son.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an ‘twere any nightingale.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac’d man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Why, what you will.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-fac’d. But, masters, here are your parts; and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.</p>
<p class="character quince">Quince</p>
<p>At the Duke’s oak we meet.</p>
<p class="character bottom">Bottom</p>
<p>Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings.</p>
<p class="stagedirections">Exeunt</p>
